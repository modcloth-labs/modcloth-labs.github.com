ModCloth Open Source
====================

These are the recommended minimum standards for open source code that
has been developed (was born) at ModCloth.  They should not be
considered hard and fast rules, but effort should be given to meeting
these recommendations before publishing as well as revisiting projects
that have already been published.

As with IETF and W3C documents, this document makes use of **MUST** and
**SHOULD** to indicate levels of importance.  Breaking from
recommendations that use "**MUST**" should not be taken lightly.

## License

Each repository **MUST** include a file named `LICENSE[.ext]`.

  - If not using the `LICENSE` filename (which **SHOULD**
  be plain text), prefer `.md` or `.rst` or something else widely used
  and easily rendered or readable in unrendered format.

The license **SHOULD** be the MIT License.

  - The Copyright line **SHOULD** be <q>Copyright (c) ModCloth, Inc.</q>
  - MIT is the default license generated by `bundler gem` and is
  otherwise available
  [on the OSI website](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  - Some code generation libraries such as `bundler` omit the line
  declaring the license to be MIT.  A line reading "MIT License"
  **SHOULD** be added to the `LICENSE` file below the top Copyright
  line.

## Contribution Guidelines

Each repository **SHOULD** include a file named `CONTRIBUTING[.ext]`.

  - If not using the `CONTRIBUTING` filename (which **SHOULD**
  be plain text), prefer `.md` or `.rst` or something else widely used
  and easily rendered or readable in unrendered format.

The contribution guidelines **SHOULD** include the following:

  - Whether or not pull requests are accepted (they should be!)
  - Whether feature branches are expected for every change or requesting
  pulls from the `master` branch of a fork is acceptable.
  - Whether or not to add oneself to the `AUTHORS` file.
  - Which branch is considered "trunk" (typically `master`) so that pull
  request submitters know which branch to target.
  - What a pull request submitter should expect.

## Authors

Each repository **SHOULD** include a file named `AUTHORS[.ext]`.

  - If not using the `AUTHORS` filename (which **SHOULD**
  be plain text), prefer `.md` or `.rst` or something else widely used
  and easily rendered or readable in unrendered format.
  - If present, the `AUTHORS` file **MUST** contain a list of the
  original authors.  The names **SHOULD** be `Firstname Lastname` and the
  list **SHOULD** be alphabetized.

## Versioning

If applicable, each project **SHOULD** contain a version that follows
the rules of [semver](http://semver.org/).

  - The first publicly-released version **SHOULD** be `0.1.0`.
